    "content": "To create a new Angular component using the Angular CLI, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nng generate component component-name\n```\n\nReplace `component-name` with the name you want to give to the new component. This command will create a new folder with the component files in the `src/app` directory, along with the necessary updates to the app module.\n\nFor example, if you want to create a new component named `my-component`, you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\nng generate component my-component\n```\n\nThis will create a folder named `my-component` with the component files inside, as well as update the app module to include the new component.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."
