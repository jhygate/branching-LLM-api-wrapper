Run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\nng generate component component-name\n```\n\nReplace `component-name` with the desired name for your new component.\n\n4. The Angular CLI will create a new folder with the component files (HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and spec files) and update the necessary files to include the new component.\n\n5. You can now use and import the newly created component in your Angular application."
