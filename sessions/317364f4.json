Here's a simple example of a code snippet in Python that generates a random password:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password(length):\n    characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n    password = ''.join(random.choice(characters) for i in range(length))\n    return password\n\npassword_length = 12\nrandom_password = generate_password(password_length)\nprint(random_password)\n```\n\nThis code will create a random password of a specified length using a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. You can customize the length of the password by changing the `password_length` variable."
