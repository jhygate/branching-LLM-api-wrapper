Here's a simple Python code snippet that generates a random number between 1 and 10:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nrandom_number = random.randint(1, 10)\nprint(\"Random number generated: \", random_number)\n```\n\nYou can run this code in your Python environment to see a random number being generated each time you run the script. Let me know if you would like to see more code examples or have any specific requests!"

Here's another Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nnum = 5\nprint(\"Factorial of\", num, \"is\", factorial(num))\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `factorial` that recursively calculates the factorial of a given number. In this case, it calculates the factorial of 5. You can modify the `num` variable to calculate the factorial of a different number. Let me know if you'd like to see more examples or have any other requests!"
