    "content": "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that allows us to structure our code in a more organized and modular way by representing real-world entities as objects. In Python, everything is an object, and we can create our own classes to define new types of objects.\n\nHere is an example of defining a simple class in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Car:\n    def __init__(self, brand, model, year):\n        self.brand = brand\n        self.model = model\n        self.year = year\n\n    def display_info(self):\n        print(f\"{self.brand} {self.model} - Year: {self.year}\")\n\n# Creating an instance of the Car class\nmy_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n\n# Calling the display_info method to display information about the car\nmy_car.display_info()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Car` class represents a car object with attributes `brand`, `model`, and `year`. The `__init__` method is the constructor that initializes these attributes when a new car object is created. The `display_info` method prints out information about the car.\n\nBy utilizing OOP concepts like classes and objects, we can create reusable and scalable code that can be easily maintained and extended."
