    "content": "Sure, here is an example of a Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    return n * factorial(n-1)\n\nnum = 5\nresult = factorial(num)\n\nprint(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function called `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number `n`. It then calculates the factorial of 5 and prints the result."
