    "content": "Certainly! Here is more information on \"Functions and modules\" in Python:\n\nFunctions:\n- Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable chunks and improve code reusability and readability.\n- You can define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters within parentheses. The function body is indented and contains the code to be executed.\n- Functions can accept parameters (inputs) and return values (outputs). Parameters are specified within the parentheses when defining the function, and the `return` statement is used to return a value from the function.\n- Functions can be called multiple times with different arguments, allowing you to achieve the same task with varying input values.\n- Python also supports anonymous functions, known as lambda functions, which are defined using the `lambda` keyword and are typically used for simple operations within a single line of code.\n\nModules:\n- Modules in Python are files containing Python code that define functions, classes, and variables. They allow you to organize related code into separate files for better structure and maintainability.\n- You can import modules in your Python script using the `import` statement, followed by the name of the module. Once imported, you can access the functions, classes, and variables defined in the module using dot notation.\n- Python has a vast standard library that includes built-in modules for various purposes, such as math operations (`math` module), working with dates and times (`datetime` module), and interacting with the operating system (`os` module).\n- You can also create your own modules by defining functions, classes, and variables in a separate Python file and importing them into other scripts as needed.\n- Packages are a way to organize and distribute collections of modules. A package is a directory that contains one or more modules and an `__init__.py` file to indicate that the directory is a package."

    "content": "Sure! Here are some example code snippets demonstrating functions and modules in Python:\n\n### Functions:\n\n```python\n# Define a simple function to add two numbers\ndef add_numbers(a, b):\n    return a + b\n\n# Call the function with arguments 5 and 3\nresult = add_numbers(5, 3)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n\n# Define a function with default parameter value\ndef greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n# Call the function without providing a name\nwelcome_message = greet()\nprint(welcome_message)  # Output: Hello, Guest!\n```\n\n### Modules:\n\nCreate a module file named `math_operations.py` containing the following code:\n\n```python\n# math_operations.py\n\ndef square(num):\n    return num ** 2\n\ndef cube(num):\n    return num ** 3\n```\n\nThen, create a Python script to import and use the functions from the `math_operations` module:\n\n```python\n# main.py\n\nimport math_operations\n\n# Call the square and cube functions from the math_operations module\nresult1 = math_operations.square(5)\nresult2 = math_operations.cube(3)\n\nprint(result1)  # Output: 25\nprint(result2)  # Output: 27\n```\n\nBy running the `main.py` script, you should see the results of calling the `square` and `cube` functions from the `math_operations` module."
